A array is a data structure which is fixed sized ordered collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
                                                       >Properties:
Contiguous memory allocation: array stores elements in consecutive memory locations, enabling O(1) access time via index-based addressing. For primitive types, the array stores actual values; for reference types, it stores memory addresses (reference) to objects.
Fixed sized
Zero-based indexing
Homogeneous elements
Length property
Default initialization
Random access in O(1) time 
                                                      >Why? Is array 
=> consider that if you have to store data of any packages stored in serial manner then it can be feasible to store in array as based on index it can be retrieve update easily and many other features available.
                                                      >>declaration and initialization
There are more than one way to declare an array in java
Way1:
Declaration only: you declare a variable that will hold an array of datatype but the size of the array isn’t defined.
Way2;
Declaration and instantiation: here you do both declare as well as create an array object of a specific size using new keyword. The elements are initialized to their default values (0 for numeric, false for Boolean, null for object reference).
Way3;
Declaration, instantiation, and initialization with values;
You declare the array and its sized is automatically determined by the number of elements you provide within the curly braces{}.
Way4;
Declaration and then instantiation: you declare an array variable first and then, at a later point in your code, create the actual array object and assign it to the variable.

                                                      >>TYPES OF ARRAYS
Single dimensional array= Stores elements in a linear format (one row).
int[] arr = new int[5]; // Declaration
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};  // Initialization
multi dimensional array=represents data in rows and columns, accessed via multiple indices.
int[][] matrix = new int[3][3]; // 2D array
int[][] jagged = new int[3][];  // Jagged array (rows with varying columns)

                                                      >>linear data structure
array is a linear data structure because it stores elements in a sequential manner,
in memory these elements are placed in contiguous blocks,
since every element is right next to the other the computer can calculate the exact memory address of any element using a simple formula, making access very fast.
the time complexity of accessing an element by index is O(1)

                                                      >>arrays of other data types
in java array are not limited to integers only. you can create arrays of primitives or objects
primitive array= int[] double[] boolean[] these stores the actual values
object array= string[] or even an array of custom class like student[]
              in an array of object the array does not store the objects themselves; it stores references(memory addresses) to where those objects live in the heap.

                                                      >>index out of bound exception
this is a common runtime error in java. it happens when you try to access an index that does not exist.
java arrays are 0 indexed if an array has a length of n the valid indices are 0 to n-1
but why starts from 0 due to offset principle which is like when you create an array java allocates a contiguous block of memory. the array variable holds the memory address of the very first element the base address
so index 0 means you are at the start- there is 0 distance from the base address and index 1 means you are 1 element away from the start.
and computational efficiency is also a reason which is based on formula > Location = Base Address + (Index × Size of Element)

                                                      >>passing arrays to methods
when you pass an array to a method you are passing the reference to the array not a copy of the whole array
so if the method changes the elements of the array those changes will persist outside the method which simply means it affect the original array
and this increase efficiency by not dublicating the original array

                                                      >>shallow copy vs deep copy
shallow copy is when you create a new array variable that points to the same memory address as the old one
int[] arr2 = arr1;
which results chaning in arr2 also change arr1
deep copy is when you create a completely new array in memory and copy every value over
and then both the array are independent of each other.

                                                     >>sorting(built in)
the enhanced for-loop is great for readability, but it has a specific limitation in java.
syntax: for(int num : arr){ ... }
constraint: you cannot change the values inside the original array using a for-each loop
why? the variable num is just local copy of the value at that index. assigning a new value to num does not point back to the array memory slot. use a standard for(int i=0...) loop if you need to modify elements.

                                                     >>anonymous arrays
in java you can pass an array to a method without even giving it a name:
sum(new int[]{10, 20, 30});
this is useful for quick calculations where you don't need to reuse the array later in the code.
